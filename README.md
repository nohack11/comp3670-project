### Steps to Run the program
we recommend using IntelliJ Idea with pcap4j maven packages

to run the program, please run the Jobcreator.java and then Jobseeker.java"

In order to use the program with a graphic user interface, please run GUL.java

Please note that the output of each client and server has been saved into its own txt file. 

- The program should be able to Traceroute between nodes in the network
- spy on neighbours 
- run the GUI of the code

> **To Run 1 to 1 Jobs**
>
> Set Jobseeker2.java port number to 4999
> 
> **To Run 1 to Many Jobs**
> 
> Run Jobseeker2.java on two different devices
>
> Set the port number for each to 5001 and 5002 respectively
